## Introduction

This repository is the first project of the master's degree in AI Engineering with [Profession AI](https://profession.ai), all the credits for the requests and idea go to this team.

InsuraPro Solutions is dedicated to improving the efficiency and quality of customer service for insurance companies by developing an advanced Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system that facilitates the management of customer information and their interactions with the company. Insurance businesses need a systematic, centralized way to manage customer information and track interactions. Many current systems are fragmented or non-user-friendly, hindering operational effectiveness and customer satisfaction. 

Objective:
- InsuraPro Solutions will offer an interactive console application developed in C++ that will allow users to manage customer information and their interactions efficiently and intuitively, thus improving customer service and internal management.

In this project, I will implement:
- **OOP in C++**: Implement OOP concepts for a robust and flexible structure.
- **Data Structure**: Create a data structure to store information about customers and their interactions.
- **User Interface**: Develop an interactive and intuitive command line interface.

Features to integrate:
1. Adding a Customer: Inserting new customers into the CRM.
2. Viewing Customers: View all current customers.
3. Editing a Customer: Edit the details of an existing customer.
4. Deleting a Customer: Remove customers from the CRM.
5. Search for a Customer: Search for customers by name or surname.
6. Interaction Management: Add, view and search for interactions for each customer (interactions mean appointments by the sales force and signed contracts).
7. Saving and Loading Data: Save customer and interaction data to a file (text or CSV) and load it at startup.
8. User Interface: The interface will be command-line based, with a main menu offering clear options for all necessary operations, ensuring a smooth and accessible user experience.
